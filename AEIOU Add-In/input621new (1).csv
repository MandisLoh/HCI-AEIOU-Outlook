Change of Name for the ISTD Degree Programme," Students,

 

SUTD will be changing the name of its degree programme from the Bachelor of Engineering (Information Systems Technology and Design) to Bachelor of Engineering (puter Science and Design). Ts name change will take effect from the graduating class of 2021 and will also affect the Minor programme. 

 

The decision to change the programme name to Computer Science and Design (CSD) aims to accurately reflect the interdisciplinary nature of the puting-intensive coupled with design curriculum that students have undergone in the ISTD pillar. Multiple discussions with various stakeholders such as alumni, current students, faculty and industry also ghlighted strong reasons in support of ts change.

 

In a survey of 177 participants from the stakeholder groups, 83% of them were in favour of renaming it Computer Science and Design (CSD)

The curriculum of the CSD degree programme will remain essentially unchanged and is still accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Board (EAB). 

ISTD will continue to retain its pillar name at the Pillar level as it extensively covers general topics related to information systems and puter science.

 ,

Thank you for looking into ts program! I've taken note of the tentative dates from 20-24 December 2021, we can finalise the date when more details are being firmed up.

The P3 & P4 class size is 21 pax & 13 pax respectively. On our end, we are alright for the on-site engagement to still carry on with ts age group, though unvaccinated. 
Thank you for giving us the assurance that your team will be fully vaccinated by then!

Looking at the current cases & safe discing measures, it is good to have an online schle planned out like what your team initiated. 
In view of that, may I please suggest that your team propose a cut-off date for us to make a decision on whether we should proceed with an on-site or online program regardless of future changes in the safe discing measures? Ts is to ensure that there is sufficient time for both parties adjust the program & getting the attendance of the cldren.

The general safe discing measures that we have in our centre as of now a

- No more than 5 pax per group for activities/discussion, including students & volunteers
- Classes of different levels are not allowed to mingle 
- To try our best to maintain 1 metre disce between individuals & groups 

As the detailed safe discing measures may change frequently, above are some basic general guidelines for us to follow. If there is anytng else to add on along the way, I will keep you updated. Hope ts clarifies!

Please feel free to contact me if more clarification is needed! Thank you.

 Geraldine,  

 

ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s some really great news! Looking forward to working with your team.  

 

After much discussion with my team, we are likely to organize the program on either of these dates, 20-24 December 2021, after our finals examination. In addition, we are looking into designing the program for P3 and/or P4 students. A query we have would be that is it possible to plan activities for ts age group, as t cannot be vaccinated? If possible, may we know the cohort size for P3 and P4 respectively? If itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not encouraged, would changing our target group to above 12 years old be more suitable? On our side, please rest assured that my team will be fully vaccinated by then.  

 

As much as we love to organize an on-site activity, we would plan an online schle as well in case of any sudden wave of infection (touchwood!). Is it possible to share with us some safe management measures that you observe so that we can include similar measures in the proposal?  

 

Thank you so much and hope to hear from you soon!  

 

Have a great day!

For a start, our centre consists of approximately 100 cldren, ranging from P1 to Sec 2, age 7 to 14 years old. We have 6 staff-in-charge for the respective classes. May I please ask if there is a specific age group you are looking at?


I undersd that there are no fixed plans as of now as it is still quite some time away from Christmas. We can discuss along the way when more ideas are generated!

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you've further queries.

 Parul, Sheena

 

Great speaking to you. I have attached a Word file of the Ebook. 

 

Here's my undersding of the decisions & requests for samples, wch would help us in quickly implementing the changes: 

*	All changes in Preface & front matter: I have attached the word file with the preface and front matter. Please feel free to make requisite edits.  
*	Please use a gh-res D logo: Please help us with a gh-res D logo 
*	I had remended a Cover Page/ an Illustration for the  E-book. Can it still be explored? Please help us with a Word editable version of the Cover page. 
*	Subheads witn stories should be sentence-cased. Please help us with a sample. 
*	All titles should be initial caps. Please help us with a sample. 
*	Images witn the same story, if possible, should ideally be of the same dimensions, especially if tÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re placed side by side; images should also align with column widths as much as possible. We can try to adjust the images a bit, but can't promise, as the original images might have underlng issues. We will crop/ adjust wherever possible. Please help us with the new images that you mentioned. 
*	Remove all image credits (should be quite self-explanatory that the images originated from the respective sources/authors); You can either change Ã¢â‚¬Å“FigureÃ¢â‚¬Â to Ã¢â‚¬Å“ImageÃ¢â‚¬Â if t are Ã¢â‚¬Å“ImagesÃ¢â‚¬Â and  drawings or illustrations be Ã¢â‚¬Å“FigureÃ¢â‚¬Â. However, you can also remove all the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Figure 1Ã¢â‚¬Â, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Figure 2Ã¢â‚¬Â etc at the start of each caption as itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s obvious the captions are for the acpanng photos. OK, please help us with the sentence you want for image credits. 
*	Having pull-out quotes is good Ã¢â‚¬â€œ suggest to have them in all stories to break the monotony (especially so for those stories without any photos). We agreed that we will keep current pagination & layout (pull out quotes in all stories will lead to spill over). 
*	A lot of the photos appear at the end of each story wch isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t ideal. Would it be possible to better feature them earlier on in the story, e.g. when itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first mentioned, so readers can reference to them and it makes for a more engaging story, instead of just text. We will try to acmodate as much as possible. 
*	Also, we would like to propose a joint ownersp i.e. both SUTD and D for the E-book as per www.artsresourcehub.gov./legal-support/intellectual-property-copyright#:~:text=In%20joint%20copyright%20ownersp%2C%20each,creation%20of%20ts%20joint%20work <apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook/?url=%3A%2F%2Fwww.artsresourcehub.gov.%2Flegal-support%2Fintellectual-property-copyright%23%3A~%3Atext%3DIn%2520joint%2520copyright%2520ownersp%252C%2520each%2Ccreation%2520of%2520ts%2520joint%2520work&data=04%7C01%7C_%40.sutd..%7C153f43f0145d4d7f7fcb08d94c57e5ab%7C3476b776e9904f72b95062489831623d%7C0%7C0%7C637624762985274120%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=Bgcnhe3C7b8B%2BMaoD%2F4XBXkajGYNRJUBcpskRtMLSeQ%3D&reserved=0> . Please help us with the sentence you'd like us to insert in the copyright page. 
*	We will go with the map that we currently have as it is based on D template. 
*	QR codes have been used as 'fillers' in wte space, we will create links wherever possible. 
*	We will update TOC for greater readability.

 Sumbul,

 

We have gone through the PDF and collated our ments. Most of them have been added witn the doc itself but sharing some over-arcng points here as well. Also, will SUTD be proof-reading the stories once the contributors confirm and give their consent as well. We too of course will be doing with the same.

 

Here are some pointers:

*	All copy should be British spelling; spell out one to nine
*	Subheads witn stories should be sentence-cased
*	All titles should be initial caps
*	Images witn the same story, if possible, should ideally be of the same dimensions, especially if tÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re placed side by side; images should also align with column widths as much as possible
*	Remove all image credits (should be quite self-explanatory that the images originated from the respective sources/authors); You can either change Ã¢â‚¬Å“FigureÃ¢â‚¬Â to Ã¢â‚¬Å“ImageÃ¢â‚¬Â if t are Ã¢â‚¬Å“ImagesÃ¢â‚¬Â and  drawings or illustrations be Ã¢â‚¬Å“FigureÃ¢â‚¬Â. However, you can also remove all the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Figure 1Ã¢â‚¬Â, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Figure 2Ã¢â‚¬Â etc at the start of each caption as itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s obvious the captions are for the acpanng photos
*	Having pull-out quotes is good Ã¢â‚¬â€œ suggest to have them in all stories to break the monotony (especially so for those stories without any photos)
*	A lot of the photos appear at the end of each story wch isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t ideal. Would it be possible to better feature them earlier on in the story, e.g. when itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first mentioned, so readers can reference to them and it makes for a more engaging story, instead of just text.

Great, thanks! 

*	We will proceed with emailing the contributors and will send you a copy of the mail + google form to collect proofs, for your reference. 
*	Just so you know, we are a bit tight on manpower again as two of our interns have left. We will take care of the most pressing issues in the eBook. 
*	We are checking internally about getting an ISBN number.

 Sumbul,

 

Thank you for the draft. We are in principle ok but do have a few suggestions on some of the details. We are still collating them from a couple of our team members. However, we are not yet proof reading the stories. We would like to do that post you sharing and having received back the proofs from the contributors. Hence, if you want to proceed with that you may and I will also send our ments before the end of ts week.

 

Once you have received the proofs from the contributors, we can go through it again for final approval.

 

Let me know your thoughts.

 

Thank you,

Parul

I am pleased to attach the current draft of the Call for Stories Ebook. 

*	Stories have been basic grammar checked, proof-read, and adjusted to fit in the template. 
*	We have edited some stories (largely the student stories, and those from overseas) to improve the coherence. 
*	We have removed three stories, as those were invalid entries. 
*	We have adapted the Preface sent by D. 

We need the following from you:

1.	List of D personnel to be included in the acknowledgements page

Best, 

Sumbul

I am sure t will be more than happy to have your experience share there too. Let me know if that is ok with you.

We would require assisce to record whenever the teams are in Breakout Rooms. The Zoom recordings do take a wle to convert if the recording is too long, so a suggestion would be to stop the recording during your lunch/dinner breaks and resume recording during the discussions.

We would require assisce to record whenever the teams are in Breakout Rooms. The Zoom recordings do take a wle to convert if the recording is too long, so a suggestion would be to stop the recording during your lunch/dinner breaks and resume recording during the discussions.

 

I will be recording the main Zoom room lectures, hence you are not required to record during those times.

 

Do feel free to let me know if there are any issues accessing the link, or if there are any questions. I must apologize that there has been some ccups/last min changes today as we started Day 1 of ts virtual programme.. I hope everyone is able to have fun and enjoy the rest of the programme in the next 3 days. Ã°Å¸ËœÅ

Ã¢â„¢â€ Finale Tournament Sign-Ups: THE SUTD WEEK OF CHESS Ã¢â„¢Å¡," all,

SUTD Chess conducted a Beginner Crash Course yesterday for the SUTD Week Of Chess. We didn't manage to record the Club Player Conversations session unfortunately as the Crash Course went overtime, but those who did attend had a great time sharing different methods of game analysis.

The next and final event of the Week Of Chess is the Finale Tournament! The tournament starts at 8PM tomorrow, and the winner of the tournament will win a tournament-size chess set, with a cloth-backed vinyl board and full-sized wooden pieces!






To participate, follow these steps:

1.	Join SUTD Chess. Fill up the sign-up form   by Sep 16, Thu, 1800. Make sure the details are accurate - any users in the tournament that cannot be matched to a submitted username in the form will be kicked after ts timing.
2.	Join the Lichess.org team and then the SUTD Week Of Chess Tournament>  by Sep 16, Thu, 1800. You can find the password to join the team on Discord.
3.	Be in the Discord's >  lounge voice channel by Sep 16, Thu, 2000, and have your webcam video and your screen shared for the duration of the tournament, to ensure fair play. You can find how to share your video and your screen on Discord here <

 

Just want to watch the games? Yogesh, Jason, and I will be mentating on the games on Twitch .










However, as I was telling the participants in the Beginner Crash Course yesterday, I really tnk that you should join the tournament even if you don't tnk you will do well. Remember that ability in chess is not an indicator of intelligence - chess is just a game, and like any other game, one gets better by plang more and developing pattern recognition. Nobody is going to judge you for losing games - every single chess player has lost countless.




I only started plang last December, after being inspired by The Queen's Gambit. I lost every single game in my first tournament (NUS Invitational 2021), but it was still one of the best learning experiences I've had. Since then, I've managed to score a decent 5 points out of 11 games at the more recent Jurong Spring National Day Blitz Championsp. The master has lost more games than the beginner has ever played, and the only way to get better is to put yourself out there to gain more experience. 




If you already signed up for the club and didn't register for the tournament, but have now changed your mind, you can use ts form to register for the tournament now!




If you really do still feel not very confident about plang in the main tournament, you can join ts beginner tournament   instead that runs at the same time as the main tournament. There are no prizes for ts one - it's just a low-stakes way for you to get more experience.




Finally, if you've been impressed by the Week Of Chess so far, do join SUTD Chess by filling up ts form  . We'll be conducting equally gh-quality events and engaging our members throughout the term.




Much love,

Kyra

The stall employee suffered severe facial injuries in the process.  In turn, the stall employee chased the technician for a short disce before returning to the stall.  The incident was over in a matter of a few minutes. 

 

Upon being alerted, two of our security officers arrived on the scene promptly.  As part of our University Security Protocol, the security supervisor confirmed that there were no safety threats to other canteen users. T detained both parties involved wle waiting for the arrival of the police and the paramedics. After receiving treatment for their injuries, both men were arrested.

 

Regardless of the subsequent penal actions arising from the Police investigation, the University has informed the employers of both men that t are barred from working on campus with immediate effect. We will also take punitive action under the contract against the two contractor panies.

 

From our preliminary investigation and interviews, ts incident was a result of impulsive reactions to a situation rather than a premeditated intent to cause hurt. After both men had calmed down, t expressed regret for behaving recklessly.

 

For any security-related incidents or emergencies on campus, students and employees can call our 24/7 Security Hotline at Tel: 6303 6666 for assisce or the police at Tel: 999.

4.       Each OSA group will choose ONLY ONE project.

5.       Entire project is worth 10 % for each participating subject (Elective + HASS + Modelling Uncertainty).

6.       Project is graded in an integrated fason, but the grade obtained in the project will be given to all participating subjects.

7.       Passing grade means a TRANSCRIPT ENTRY as in previous semesters.

Have you ever had any burning issues or feedback you would like to raise up? Or do you want to be kept updated of the current issues that have already been brought up? Well, regardless of wch one you want, ROOT has a solution for you. ROOT has rolled out its every own ROOT Telebot so you can raise up issues as and when you want. You can also use it to check the repository of feedback that has already been mentioned. 

 

Attached in ts email will be a brief manual on how to use the bot and the link to the Telebot itself! But do not worry too much, the bot is user-friendly and very intuitive, with instructions in every step! Now you may be wondering where does all ts feedback go? Is ts simply a venting platform for students? Well, t are valid questions but fret not! Each feedback sent through the bot will be routed to ROOT where we will collate, organize, and use ts collected feedback for the Dialogues with Senior Management. We hope ts initiative by ROOT will help increase the voices of students like you who would be able to make a better world in SUTD (by design)! 

 

You can access the bot via ts telehandle @SUTD_ROOT_bot or via ts link

2021 September Term - 10.020 : Data Driven World: DDW Lessons Arrangement when In-Campus Activity Starts," Students,

The University is going to announce that students can go back to campus soon. Since we do not know when ts announcement will arrive, DDW faculty decided to have a fixed schle of in-campus and online lessons regardless when the in-campus activity begins. Ts is to help you all to be prepared and not surprised by any sudden announcements from the University.

At the same time, we are aware that many of you may have concerns about ing back to campus due to the recent cases in COVID-19, and you may have older family members you wish to protect. We fully undersd your concerns and, therefore, decided to have the following measures to rce the risk of transmission.

*	When in-campus lessons kick-in, DDW lessons will have alternate weeks between in-campus and online lessons. The schle is as follows:
	Week 4: in-campus
	Week 5: online
	Week 6: in-campus
	Week 7: recess
	Week 8: in-campus
	Week 9: online
	Week 10: in-campus
	Week 11: online
	Week 12: in-campus
	Week 13: online

*	In the case when in-campus activity starts at Week 5, we will still follow the above schle. The above schle is also indicated in the Course HandoutÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Course Calendar  .

*	The purpose of alternating weeks is to rce the risk. A few of our faculty teaches more than three classes and that amounts to meeting more than 200 students. Alternating the weeks rces the risk that any faculty may bee the source of spread among the students. In the week of in-campus lessons, there will only be one lead instructor in the class and the supporting Faculty will continue to support you online through MS Teams. You are allowed to initiate a video call during the lessons with the supporting faculty or TA in class. Please use your earphones so as not to disrupt the physical class. The reason for ts separation is to ensure that the class can continue if the lead instructor is down due to a positive case or quarantine. 

*	The trd sessions (Lessons 3) in the week are usually dedicated to doing Mini Projects in Weeks 4 to 6. Since the measures only allow two-person group works, we will move all trd sessions in Weeks 4 to 6 to online lessons regardless of the weeks. Ts allows groups of three persons to continue to work together and get checkoffs from instructors using MS Teams.

*	You are not required to physically attend DDW lessons and we will live-stream all lessons using MS Teams and record it at the respective channels for each Cohorts. Please remind the lead instructor to record it or you can initiate the recording yourself. We undersd that other subjects may still require you to attend the class physically and it is the decision of each subject leads wch we have no control over. 

*	It is import that both faculty and students put their best efforts to rce the risk by keeping personal hygiene and rcing close-contact interactions during the physical lessons. Though Faculty will try their best to minimize interaction, it is natural that Faculty tend to help students during the lessons and you may municate to the faculty if there are any actions that make you unfortable. We will remind one another to ensure that masks are worn at all times and those who are not well should remain at home. Ts applies to Faculty as well as students.

We make ts decision for the best of all and we seek your undersding during ts time. We mit our best efforts to deliver the best possible learning experience for you. Thank you.

Notes written during class for 30th September," all,

Some of you asked for the notes written during class just now, so here t are. 

Cheers,
Jia 

--------- Below is inconsequential to your grades/exam and can be ignored but it can be fun too ---------------
--------- Spoiler alert for 'Squid Game' -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've seen some of you who are quite fast in class, so to challenge you, I randomly came up with questions. The question is inspired by the Netflix series 'Squid Game'. In Game 5, the contests are supposed to walk through a glass bridge with 18 steps (or was it some other number?). For each step, there are 2 choices, one is tempered glass that cannot withsd the weight of a single person, wle the other is glass that can withsd the weight of 2 people. There's no way to tell the two types of glasses apart and you are eliminated (i.e. die) if you step on the wrong glass. So, we know that the probability for contest 1 (who walks the bridge first) to cross the bridge is 1/2^18 because he/she must guess the correct pieces for 18 steps. We also know that the 19th contest can definitely cross safely, because even if everyone else before m/her is unlucky and guess the wrong one, by the 19th person, all the tempered glass would have shattered. What's the probability that the mth contest (where m <= 18) can cross safely? I have no idea what the answer is, I was just tnking of ts wle watcng the series, so if you know a solution, please tell me. If you don't undersd the question, then go watch 'Squid Game', and if your parents ask you why you are not studng, you can just say you are studng probability now (but please undersd the course material too and try to apply them wle watcng the series). 

Actually, we can set some probability question around Game 2 as well (the one with the dalgona candy). Say the probability of contests choosing Star, Circle, Triangle, and Umbrella are all equal. Probability of success for star, circle, triangle, and umbrella are 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.3 respectively. What's the probability of success? In ts case, you will be using the law of total probability. P(success) = P(success|star)P(star) + P(success|circle)P(circle) + P(success|triangle)P(triangle) + P(success|umbrella)P(umbrella). 


 Ts is just to demonstrate that the current course you are taking is very applicable to real life. We can always spot some examples of its application!

Cohort Exco List," all,

 

Just a gentle reminder to meet up with your cohort (if you havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t) and form the exco member for the class by 8 Oct (at least for the Chair and Deputy Chair). Ts is because the management would like to invite them for a  dialogue session sometime next week, so would appreciate if we could have the Chair and Deputy Chair formed. Undersd the students required more time to recruit the members as students havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t got much chance to know their peers well given classes remained online for the past 3 weeks. You can suggest the class to send 1 or 2 representative for now and elect one when t feel fortable. 

 

For the rest of the excos, you may submit the list by 15 Oct. Library, OSA, Fab Lab, AV will also be conducting briefing for the use of equipment, library books, first aid training and munication on exams process specifically for the AV, Library, Fab Lab and first aid reps, Chair and Deputy for their respective roles. We also need to grant access to the stationery reps to access the vending macnes.

 

Please try to arrange a meet up with the class via online ts week. 

 

Thank you

 Term 1 Class Fund Claim Procedure," ,

 

The students can spend the class fund of $250 for ts term even if t have not selected the treasurer yet. But t have to seek the approval from  the faculty / staff cohort advisor. We can only conduct the frist exco meeting when all the cohorts excos are elected. Most of the  cohort advisors are experience and t have also been cohort advisors for last few years. Thus t would be able to  advise the class on the claims process  eg filling in the budget utilisation form and submitting the claims through the Concur system together with the receipts. We will conduct the briefing for the claims process during the first excos meeting. Meanwle students may consult their cohort advisors for advise on the claims  process before the first excos dialogue sesson. For info the concur system is under Finance and if students required a detailed breifng on the system, we will need to seek FiannceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s help to conduct the briefing.

 

In all cases, please consult the faculty cohort advisors first. Most of them except for the new cohort advisors are very experienced and t would be able to advise the students  base on a case by case basis.

 

Let me know if you still encounter any problems.

 

Thanks
